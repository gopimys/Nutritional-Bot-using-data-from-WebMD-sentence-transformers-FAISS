creating a nutrition search engine powered by data from WebMD using sentence-transformers, FAISS

### Building Nutrition Chatbot using sentence-transformers , FAISS and BeautifulSoup
- **scrape the internet for content that we can use to supplement an LLM like ChatGPT's**
- **we'll gather information from [Nourish by WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/diet/default.htm) and process articles to create a databank of sources on nutrition that will be used to power a nutrition chatbot.**
-  **using sentence-transformers(multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1 model since it is extremely fast ) and FAISS(indexing algorithms b META AI) to create a vector store index to connect the databank we created to an LLM like ChatGPT**
**- we initialize self.embeddings to a numpy array of shape (0,384)â€”this is because the multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1 Sentence Transformers model provides a vector with 384 dimensions**
